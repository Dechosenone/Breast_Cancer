In this study, we investigate feature selection in medical datasets for breast cancer prediction employing six binary classification algorithms. We utilize two feature selection methods in conjunction with the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier: nested cross-validation with grid search for hyperparameter tuning and K-fold cross-validation for evaluating feature importance. These techniques amplify model robustness and interpretability while curbing overfitting. Our comparative study illuminates that hyperparameter optimization enhances the performance of all tested algorithms. We identify the optimal feature count for maximizing model precision and propose a robust machine learning approach for precise breast cancer prediction. This underscores the pivotal role of feature selection in healthcare predictive models.
